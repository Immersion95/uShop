# uShop
Downloads Wii U games in an installable format from the CDN.

## What this program will do
This program will download the .app/.h3/.cert/.tmd files from the CDN.  
It will then generate a .tik file in the same directory.  
You can install the contents generated by this program with [WUP Installer GX2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wup-installer-gx2/).

## Disclaimer
This program is largely unfinished. Report any bugs in issues, please.

## Usage
You must have the Wii U common key in the file named ckey.json.  
Also, Python 3.5+ (?) and pycryptodome are requirements to use this program. Install it with:

    $ python3 -m pip install pycryptodome

To download:

    $ ./ushop.py <titleid> [version]
